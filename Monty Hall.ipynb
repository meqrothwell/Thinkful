    "In the Monty Hall problem, before any door is revealed the probability (prior?) that a door would contain the prize would be 1/3 for each door. Once one of the doors that was not chosen has been eliminated, the probability for that door would be added to the door that remains but was not chosen by the contestant, resulting in that door's probability becoming 2/3. Thus, the contestant should always switch their chosen door to have the best chance of winning. "
