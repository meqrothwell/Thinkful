    "**1. What is the 1994 rate of juvenile delinquency in the U.S.?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Bad. This question simply asks for a number and does not require any sort of modeling. A better question would be something like \"what were the main causes of juvenile delinquency in the U.S. in 1994?'\n",

    "**2. What can we do to reduce juvenile delinquency in the U.S.?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Good.\n",

    "**3. Does education play a role in reducing juvenile delinquents' return to crime?**\n",

    "**4. How many customers does AT&T currently serve in Washington, DC?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Bad. This question is asking for a raw number and does not require any modeling. The answer should be very simple. A better question would be 'how many customers in the DC area can AT&T expect to have over the next five years?'\n",

    "\n",
    "Good.\n",

    "**9. Is it better to read to children at night or in the morning?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Bad. This research question needs to be more specific, particularly in its definition of the word 'better'. It is unclear what the should be studied -- is it child intelligence as a result of when they are read to? Or occurrences of ADD? Or something else entirely? A better question would be 'how does reading to a child at night increase their SAT scores?' \n",
