If the prices of each of the goods fluctuated -- because of special offers, coupons, etc -- I would calculate the differences in conversions at each of the price points. Finally, I would compare the profit margins for each of the goods and take that into consideration when making my recommendation to the head of advertising. "

    "2) You work at a web design company that offers to build websites for clients. Signups have slowed, and you are tasked with finding out why. The onboarding funnel has three steps: email and password signup, plan choice, and payment. On a user level you have information on what steps they have completed as well as timestamps for all of those events for the past 3 years. You also have information on marketing spend on a weekly level.\n"

    "I would use the funnel steps to see where the biggest dropoff in conversion to the next step occurs, and comapre that with the pattern that existed before our signups slowed. I would also take a look at the timestamps to see if users are spending an increased amount of time on a specific step, and look at the history to figure out why. For example, if we changed payment systems recently and users are spending more time on the payment step without converting, that may be because it is not as clear how to complete the process from a user perspective, causing loss in conversions. I would also check the completed onboarding steps against the marketing spend. If marketing spend has dropped, that could give a clear cause as to why signups have slowed. "
